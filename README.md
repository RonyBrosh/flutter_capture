# flutter_capture
A shell script to easily capture Android and iOS screenshots and videos.
Just download this script to your download folder or any other folder you want the result files to be created.

Please note, You might need to run in your terminal</br>
**chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh**</br> (or just the file name if you're in the same folder as the script e.g. chmod +x screen_capture.sh)
before running the actual script</br>
**./screen_capture.sh**</br>

By the way, if you want to make it clickable just replace the **.sh** extension with **.command** and you'll be able to double click the file.
The folder where youu double clicked the file will be the destination folder for the result files.

Please also note, I tested only on macOS if you find any issues on other platforms feel free to contribute to this script.
